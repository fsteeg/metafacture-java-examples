h1. Metafacture Java Examples

This is a minimal Java 8 Maven project with solutions to the exercises from the workshop "Analysis of library metadata with Metafacture":http://swib.org/swib13/slides/boehme_swib13_131.pdf conducted by Christoph BÃ¶hme at SWIB13. It can be used as a template for Java projects using Metafacture.

The processing pipelines or workflows are built using the typesafe Metafacture Java API directly, not the Flux DSL.

Prerequisites: Java 8, Maven 3
