This is an Eclipse project with solutions to the exercises from the workshop "Analysis of library metadata with Metafacture":http://swib.org/swib13/slides/boehme_swib13_131.pdf conducted by Christoph BÃ¶hme at SWIB13. It can be used as a playground for getting familiar with "Metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-documentation and the "Metafacture IDE":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-ide.
